# AccessAbility
**Not all of us can play with two hands or arms, or dive to avoid walls, but that shouldn't stop any of us from being able to enjoy the game!**
**A true one-hand and sitting-friendly mod. Play any map. With only the blocks of your color-choice in their original patterns. Turn off wall-damage, Remove crouch walls, Unbreakable bombs.**

**And still keep your scores.**

This mod allows you to play the original map with blocks and other elements turned off _without forced score deduction or NF_.
I want to make this game as accessible and enjoyable for as many of us as possible. It's your game, your ability, and your definition of skill and fun :)

Supports Left and Right hand playersettings, Multiplayer, OST/DLC, Custom and Base Campaigns, Party, Practice, and ScoreSaber Submission! For BS 1.18.3+

## How Is This Different From AlternativePlay?
This mod *does not convert* all the blocks to one color or to dot blocks, which can make a map difficult or unpleasant to play single-handed.
AccessAbility *deletes the blocks* of a color and thus accurately represents playing the original map with only one hand.

If you want to see the whole map but play only one color, AccessAbility can set a color to vanish without counting them as misses.

## New Features
**v4.0.0** (BS 1.20.0+ only)
- **Unmodified Scores:** Play using the bomb and wall features without score deduction for local, party, multiplayer and base campaign scores

**v3.0.0** (≤BS 1.19.0)
- **Indestructible Bombs:** Enjoy the visual effect of bombs
- **Friendly Walls:** Play with the visual and haptic effects of walls without needing to physically avoid them
- **No Crouch Walls:** Play with only full-height walls. All crouch-height walls are deleted regardless if crouching is necessary to avoid them. Can be combined with `Friendly Walls`
- These features when enabled will override behavior of base game wall and bomb modifiers

## How To Use
- Place AccessAbility.dll in your Plugins folder
- Set the toggles to what is comfortable for you and have fun!
- Adjust the `Disappearing Distance` slider for how near the blocks are to you when they vanish. 6.0 keeps them out of saber-reach. At 3.0 and below, score submission is automatically turned off (only if SS or CC installed)
- To play without score deductions, toggle on `Unmodified Scores`. Upload to base game online leaderboards will be turned off. This feature will only activate (even if toggled on) if ScoreSaber and CustomCampaigns are not installed
- Requires BSML and BS Utils

## Scores
- **In-Map:** Only the color you are playing will be scored :)
- **Unmodified Scores:** Local, party and multiplayer scores will not be affected by `Friendly Walls`, `Turn Off Crouch Walls`, or `Indestructable Bombs`
- **Results Page and Submission:** If submitting, your passing score % will be as if the turned-off or disappearing blocks were 0's, FC and Rank are not affected :) You can turn off submission and keep your BeatSavior and SliceVisualizer Data but local scores and replays will not be saved. `Friendly Walls` or `Turn Off Crouch Walls` subtracts 5% from score like the base game No Obstacles modifier. `Indestructable Bombs` subtracts 10%.
- **`Turn Off Score Submission`** only applies when _at least one mod feature is enabled_. If you want to turn off submission across your game, see my other mod [PlayFirstSubmitLater](https://github.com/zeph-yr/PlayFirstSubmitLater)

## Play One Handed Dodge-Cube
- Set `Disappearing Distance` to 0 for the color you're not playing, then try not to hit those blocks as you play the color you want! ^^
