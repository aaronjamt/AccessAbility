# AccessAbility
**Not all of us can play with two hands or arms, or dive to avoid walls, but that shouldn't stop any of us from being able to enjoy the game!**
**A true one-hand and sitting-friendly mod. Play any map. With only the blocks of your color-choice. In their original patterns. Turn off wall-damage. Remove crouch walls. Unbreakable bombs.**

This mod allows you to play the original map with the Red, Blue, or all blocks turned off. 
Supports Left and Right Hand playersettings, Multiplayer, OST and DLC, Practice Mode, Custom and Base Campaigns. For BS 1.18.3+

## How Is This Different From AlternativePlay?
This mod *does not convert* all the blocks to one color or to dot blocks, which can make a map difficult or unpleasant to play single-handed.
AccessAbility *removes the blocks* mapped in the other color and thus accurately represents playing the original map with only one hand.

If you want to see the whole map but play only one color without the barrage of misses, AccessAbility can set one color to disappear near striking distance without being counted as misses during your play.

**v3.0.0 BS 1.19.0 Update** (Compatible with BS 1.18.3)
- **Indestructible Bombs:** Play without having to avoid hitting bombs.
- **Friendly Walls:** Play with the visual and haptic effects of walls without needing to physically avoid them.
- **No Crouch Walls:** Play with only full-height walls. All crouch-height walls are removed regardless if crouching is necessary to avoid them.
- These features when enabled will override behavior of base game wall and bomb modifiers

## How To Use
- Place AccessAbility.dll in your Plugins folder
- Set the toggles to what is comfortable for you and have fun!
- Adjust the `Disappearing Distance` slider for how close you want the blocks to come before they disappear. 6.0 keeps them out of saber-reach. At 3.0 and below, score submission is automatically turned off.
- Requires BSML and BS Utils

## Scores
- **In-Map:** Score is for the color you are playing :)
- **Results Page and Submission:** If submitting, your passing score will be as if you missed all the turned-off and disappearing blocks. You can turn off score submission and still keep your BeatSavior and SliceVisualizer Data but local scores and replays will not be saved. `Friendly Walls` or `Turn Off Crouch Walls` subtracts 5% from score like the base game No Obstacles modifier. `Indestructable Bombs` subtracts 10%.
- **`Turn Off Score Submission`** only applies when _at least one color is set to "NoBlocks" or "Disappear"_. If you want to turn off score submission across your game, see my other mod [PlayFirstSubmitLater](https://github.com/zeph-yr/PlayFirstSubmitLater)

## Play One Handed Dodge-Cube
- Set `Disappearing Distance` to 0. This means the disappearing color blocks *will* reach you, so try not to hit them! ^^
