# AccessAbility
**Not all of us can play with two hands or arms, but that shouldn't stop any of us from being able to enjoy the game!**

**A true one-hand mod. Play any map. With only the blocks of your color-choice. In their original patterns.**

This mod allows you to play the original map with the Red / Blue blocks (or both) turned off. 
Works for both Left and Right Hand modes, Multiplayer and OST / DLC.

## How Is This Different From AlternativePlay?
This mod *does not convert* the blocks of the other color to the desired color or to dot blocks, which can make a map difficult or unpleasant to play single-handedly.
AccessAbility *removes the blocks* mapped in the other color and thus accurately represents playing the original map with only one hand.

For those who like to still see the other-color blocks but not be bombarded with Miss texts and sounds, AccessAbility has the option to display them and have them disappear without being counted as Misses.

## How To Use
- Place AccessAbility.dll in your Plugins folder
- The toggles stack, so use your judgement to enable a combination that is meaningful (or don't and have some fun LOL)
- Scores submitted will be as if you missed all the other color blocks. You can disable score submission and still keep your BeatSavior and SliceVisualizer Data

## Play One Handed Dodge-Cube
- Set the Disappearing Distance slider to 0. This means the other color blocks *will* reach you, so try not to hit the wrong color!
