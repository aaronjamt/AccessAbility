# AccessAbility
**Not all of us can play with two hands or arms, but that shouldn't stop any of us from being able to enjoy the game!**

**A true one-hand mod. Play any map. With only the blocks of your color-choice. In their original patterns.**

This mod allows you to play the original map with the Red, Blue, or all blocks turned off. 
Supports Left and Right Hand playersettings, Multiplayer, OST / DLC, Practice Mode, Custom and Base Campaigns.

## How Is This Different From AlternativePlay?
This mod *does not convert* all the blocks to one color or to dot blocks, which can make a map difficult or unpleasant to play single-handed.
AccessAbility *removes the blocks* mapped in the other color and thus accurately represents playing the original map with only one hand.

If you want to see the whole map but play only one color without the barrage of Miss texts and sounds, AccessAbility can set one color to disappear near striking distance without being counted as Misses during your play.

## How To Use
- Place AccessAbility.dll in your Plugins folder
- The toggles stack, so use your judgement to enable a combination that is meaningful (or don't and have some fun LOL)
- Adjust the Disappearing Distance slider for how close you want the blocks to come before they disappear. 6.0 keeps them out of saber-reach.

## Scores
- **In-Map:** Score is only for the color you are playing
- **Results Page and Submission:** If submitting, score will be as if you missed all the other color blocks. You can disable score submission and still keep your BeatSavior and SliceVisualizer Data

## Play One Handed Dodge-Cube
- Set Disappearing Distance to 0. This means the other color blocks *will* reach you, so try not to hit the wrong color!
